1. Pandas
     Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It is used for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and data manipulation.
         # Creating a DataFrame
        data = {'Name': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'Age': [2, 3, 4]}
        df = pd.DataFrame(data)

        print(df)

2.NumPy
      NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It is used for numerical  operations on large and matrices.
          # Creating a NumPy array
          array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
          result = array + 7 

          print(result)


3.TensorFlow
        TensorFlow is a machine learning framework that has offered flexibility, scalability and performance for deep learning tasks. It is used for building and training machine learning models, particularly deep learning models.
           # Creating a simple constant tensor
            tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

            print(tensor)

4.Keras
     Keras is a high-level, deep learning API developed by Google for implementing neural networks.It is part of the TensorFlow library and allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.
         # Building a simple neural network
           model = Sequential([
                Dense(43, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
                Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
           ])
       
            model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

            print(model.summary())

5.Scikit-learn(sklearn)
       Scikit-learn is a useful library for machine learning in Python. It contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.
           # Sample data
             X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
             y = np.dot(X, np.array([1, 2])) + 3

           # Creating a linear regression model
             model = LinearRegression()
             model.fit(X, y)

             print(model.coef_)

6.PyTorch
     PyTorch is a fully featured framework for deep learning models, which is a type of machine learning that is commonly used in image recognition and language processing.
            # Creating a tensor
              tensor = torch.tensor([[3., 4.], [1., 2.]])

            # Performing matrix multiplication
              result = torch.matmul(tensor, tensor)

              print(result)
